    <p class="main-subtitle">Our Mission</p>
    <p class="main-section">At Shelter Foot Gallery, we are devoted to giving every cat a second chance at life.
       Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome cats of all breeds and backgrounds into loving, permanent homes. We provide a safe, clean, and nurturing environment where our cats receive medical care, socialization, and individual attention. Each adoption is a thoughtful process, carefully matching the personality and needs of every cat with the right family. Whether you're looking for a playful kitten or a calm senior companion, we’re here to help you find your perfect furry friend — and give them the loving home they deserve.</p>

    <p class="main-subtitle">Our Story</p>
    <p class="main-section">Founded in 2020, Shelter Foot Gallery was  
      established by a group of passionate animal lovers who wanted to make a difference in the lives of homeless cats. Our journey began with a small team and a handful of rescued cats, and has grown into a thriving community of volunteers, foster homes, and supporters. We believe that every cat deserves a chance to find their forever home, and we work tirelessly to ensure that each one receives the care and love they need. Through education, outreach, and community involvement, we aim to raise awareness about the importance of animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.</p>
